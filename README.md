# Introduction
A group project with the aim of creating an *Android* application from the conception/design to the deployment phase (*planning, analysis, design, implementation and testing* process) correlated with the related documentation.

All the material was developed for the '*Software Engineering*' [Ca' Foscari University](https://www.unive.it) bachelor's degree course in '*Technologies and Information Science*' (2017/2018).

# Application (CleAir)
The application was developed to show the **air pollution** status (*Ozone, PM10*) in a graphical/visual way in oder to provide a simple and intuitive feedbacks for all the possible users, even the non-expert ones. It also allows to see the health status of the air week by week, as well as being able to save it locally.

For the moment the coverage of the data concerns only the Veneto region (Italy). A possible future update will eventually expand its coverage to new regions/countries.

You can find all the source code in the [*'Android Application'*](Android%20Application) folder.

## Release and Availability
The CleAir application is freely downloadable from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenteadev.unive.clair) for all Android smartphones.
